# Step 1: Split up inputs A and B into useful components


# Step 2: Find maximum exponent. This will help you normalize the mantissas


# Step 3: Compose the mantissas.
# a. The IEEE standard assumses an implicit "1". Prepend the mantissas with a "1".
#    Hint: If both the mantissa and exponent are 0, then the given input is 0, so
#    We DONT want to prepend a "1"
#    https://pyrtl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers.html#pyrtl.corecircuits.concat
#
# b. In the worst case, one of the mantissas must be shifted right 30 times. Append
#    30 zeros to your mantissa so we don't lose precision

# Step 4: Normalize the mantissas
# - Use the maximum exponent to determine which mantissa has to be shifted and shift
#   it right (max_exponent - min_exponent) times.


# Step 5: Compute the sum of the mantissas. Be sure to use the correct sign of A and B
# in the calculation. To do that, apply the signs to A and Bâ€™s normalized mantissas
# and put those values in two new 42-bit wires. Then, sum those values to get a
# 43-bit signed wire.

# Step 6: Record the sign of the sum into C
# Hint: You may want to handle two different cases: (1) A and B have the same sign
# and (2) A and B have opposite signs, as this may affect your results for steps 7
# and 8

# Step 7: Calculate absolute value of sum from the previous step

# Step 8: Normalize C's mantissa. Determine how many times to shift the mantissa left
# so that the MSB is 1

# Step 9: Determine C's mantissa by using result from Step 9

# Step 10: If mantissa was shifted in Step 9, this must be accounted for in the
# result's exponent as well.

# Step 11: Produce output C. Concatenate your results for the output's sign, exponent,
# and mantissa components. Note that you may have to select only a limited set of bits
# from the sign, exponent, and fractional part WireVectors that you have in use.


# Careful: Make sure your implementation handles the case where C = 0.0
